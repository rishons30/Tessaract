## Project Details

### Overview
Our project aims to tackle the problem of tail assignment with the help of reinforcment learning. Also by adding a touch of sustainability by introducing CO2 emission reduction.

### Problem Statement
The Tail Assignment Problem involves assigning flights to aircraft while meeting constraints and ensuring all flights are scheduled. Aircraft are matched based on subtype and seating capacity, considering maintenance and pre-assigned schedules. The system allows users to define aircraft type, scheduling period, exclusions, and whether trips must stay on the same aircraft or can be split.

### Solution
We have implemented reinforcement learning covered the features provided in  the detailed problem statement along with additional features like CO2 emission reduction,chaos mode,crew management.
