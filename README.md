## Project Details
### Overview
The problem statement for our project is tail assignment we will tackle this problem using reinforcment learning and add some additional features of our own.

### Problem Statement
The Tail Assignment Problem involves assigning flights to aircraft while meeting constraints and ensuring all flights are scheduled. Aircraft are matched based on subtype and seating capacity, considering maintenance and pre-assigned schedules. The system allows users to define aircraft type, scheduling period, exclusions, and whether trips must stay on the same aircraft or can be split.

### Solution
We created a website for tail assignment problem where we implemented features provided in the detailed problem statement and also additional features like Crew management,CO2 emission reduction and use reinforcment learning.
